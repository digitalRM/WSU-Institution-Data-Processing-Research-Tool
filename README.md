# Institution Data Processing Research Tool

This project, which was originally built as an internal tool for [Washington State University](https://www.wsu.edu/) research through the [Ukrainian Book Project](https://www.ukrainianbookproject.com/), is now available to anyone for research and educational purposes. We are not affiliated with OCLC in any way. This tool utilizes the [OCLC Registry API](https://developer.api.oclc.org/wc-registry) and requires that you have access to the API. This tool is entirely open source and available on GitHub.
